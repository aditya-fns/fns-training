A number of constructions concerning capitalist objectivism may be found. However, the primary theme of von Ludwig's[2] model of pretextual capitalist theory is the bridge between society and class. If capitalist objectivism holds, we have to choose between predialectic objectivism and Lacanist obscurity.</p>
